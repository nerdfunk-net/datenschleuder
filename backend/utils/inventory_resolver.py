"""
Shared utility for resolving inventory to device lists.

This module provides a common codebase for converting saved inventory configurations
to actual lists of device IDs. This functionality is used across multiple features:

- API endpoints (POST /api/inventory/resolve-devices)
- Celery tasks (backup, jobs, etc.)
- Job templates and execution
- Any feature that needs to convert inventory → device list

The resolver ensures consistent behavior across all parts of the application.

    Resolve a saved inventory name to a list of device IDs.

    This is the primary function for inventory-to-device conversion across the entire
    application. It handles:
    1. Loading inventory from database by name
    2. Converting tree structure to LogicalOperations
    3. Evaluating operations to get matching devices
    4. Returning device UUIDs

    Args:
        inventory_name: Name of the saved inventory to resolve
        username: Username for inventory access control

    Returns:
        List of device UUIDs, or None if inventory not found or has no matching devices

    Example:
        >>> device_ids = await resolve_inventory_to_device_ids("production-routers", "admin")
        >>> print(f"Found {len(device_ids)} devices")
        Found 42 devices
